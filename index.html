            This webpage reflects my challenges and breakthroughs throughout this apprenticeship. 
            Throughout this time there has been various challenges and assignments that have stopped me in my tracks but I continued to push through. 
            Typically, giving up is usually the route I take when feeling defeated in situations. 
            However, I could not take this opportunity for granted and have found myself finding a balance to make things work by 
            asking for additional help when needed, reading intensively to broaden my scope and trying to build a strict foundation for my future in this career path. 
<p>
Being apart of Cohort 11 has taught me it is ok to ask for help. 
Before getting into this apprenticeship, I did not like asking for help because it made me feel less than. 
Now, I understand that constructive criticism is apart of the process. 
The support that was given by my peers gave me motivation and clarity to believe in myself and my capabilities. 

</p>
Road To Hire has taught me that if you want something you have to work for it. 
I cannot wait to see what other lessons I learn in the second half of the program.

        <h3>Photo Backstory Activity </h3>
        <img src="/images/bella.jpeg" alt="Bella">
<p class="explain">
I chose this work sample because this was the first public speaking exercise I did after being accepted into the program. 
I was looking through my album trying to figure out what image I should talk about. 
When I came across this picture I knew I could tell a story that would resonate with a lot of my peers because
there are many of us who are working parents or who care for children. 
After submitting this image I was unsure what story I wanted to tell, so I listened to my peers' speeches to get inspiration. 
Finally, I decided I wanted my overall message to convey the importance of letting children be children. 
<p class="relfect">
    This exercise was a good reflection piece for me because I learned the importance of receiving feedback.
    While there was structure in my speech the feedback I received was additional structure was required.
    I appreciated the feedback and decided to implement the suggested changes in my next speech. 
    Another area I needed to work on was vocal variety. 
    When I did my next speech I made sure to include areas where I varied my tone so I could keep the audience engaged. 
    Although I did not get a perfect score on this speech, I did show improvement in these two areas. 
    I believe a sign of growth is implementing constructive criticism and feedback.

<h3>E-commerce Project</h3>
<img src="/images/contact.png" alt="home page">
<p> 
The e-commerce project was a good learning experience because I learned new skills which helped me complete the assignment. 
I chose to use my business as the focus of this project because it is something that I am proud of.     
    <a href="https://main.d67mkad6vjczp.amplifyapp.com/" title="Ecommerce Project" target="_blank">
        Get It There Dispatching LLC</a> was started on June 18, 2022. 
        Prior to Road To Hire, I worked in a call center which was similar to AAA for commercial vehicles. 
        I did not enjoy the job because there were many situations where I could not help the driver. 
        When I could not help a driver it meant he or she stranded wherever they parked. 
        This meant that there were occasions when the driver was not in a safe location. 
        I decided to start <a href="https://main.d67mkad6vjczp.amplifyapp.com/" title="Ecommerce Project" target="_blank">
        Get It There Dispatching LLC</a> to provide a variety of services for owner operators to help shorten their down time and ensure their safety.
           
            <p class="reflect"> 
                To complete this project I had to implement three new skills. 
                I did not know where to begin because I had a variety of ideas for products I wanted to sell but none of them felt right. 
                I finally realized that I could use something that I know which is services for commercial vehicles. 
                After settling on the overall theme for the project, I had to come up with twelve products.
                Coming up with twelve products was fairly easy but one of the new skills was using a new method to display the products. 
                For that portion of the project I watched various videos and reached out to my tech mentor. 
                Another new skill I learned was making a slideshow on the homepage using a language called JavaScript.
                The start of this project was my first introduction to JavaScript.
                I watched YouTube to self teach making a slideshow with JavaScript.
                I was able to use what I learned to implement the required new skills.
                Amazon Web Services (AWS) is used to host websites created on local servers.
                I've previously learned what AWS was but had not used it to deploy a website.
                After speaking with my peers, I was able to complete this portion of the project easily. 
                Learning these new skills enabled me to use AWS to host my portfolio webpage.
