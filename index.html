            This webpage reflects my challenges and breakthroughs throughout this apprenticeship. 
            Throughout this time there has been various challenges and assignments that have stopped me in my tracks but I continued to push through. 
            Typically, giving up is usually the route I take when feeling defeated in situations. 
            However, I could not take this opportunity for granted and have found myself finding a balance to make things work by 
            asking for additional help when needed, reading intensively to broaden my scope and trying to build a strict foundation for my future in this career path. 
<br>
In addition, the support that was given by my peers gave me additional motivation and clarity of believing in myself and what my capabilities are. 
Being apart of Cohort 11 has taught me it is ok to ask for help and it is ok to constantly be a student. 
Before getting into this apprenticeship, I did not like asking for help because it made me feel less than. 
Now, I do not mind asking for help and I understand that getting additional opinions from others helps aid in my success. 
I am stronger and more powerful because of the consistency I have shown myself. 
I have also learned that anything I fight for and put my mind to will be accomplished. 
<br>
Road To Hire has taught me that if you want something you have to work for it. I cannot wait to see what other lessons I learn in the second half of the program.

        <h3>Photo Backstory Activity </h3>
        <img src="/images/bella.jpeg" alt="Bella">
<p class="explain">
I chose this work sample because this was the first public speaking exercise I did after being accepted into the program. 
I was looking through my album trying to figure out what image I could talk about. 
When I came across this picture I knew I could tell a story that would resonate with a lot of my peers because
there are many of us who are either a parent or who are around children. 
After submitting this image I was unsure what story I wanted to tell, so I listened to my peers' speeches to get inspiration. 
Finally, I decided I wanted my overall message to convey the importance of letting children be children. 
<p class="relfect">
    This exercise was a good reflection piece for me because I learned the importance of receiving feedback.
    While there was structure in the speech I was told it could have been better which is something that I wanted to implement in my next speech. 
    Another area I needed to work on was vocal variety. 
    When I did my next speech I made sure to include areas in my speech where I varied my tone so I could keep the audience engaged. 
    Although I did not get a perfect score on my next speech, I did show improvement in these two areas. 
    I believe a sign of growth is implementing constructive criticism and feedback.

<h3>E-commerce Project</h3>
<img src="/images/Screen Shot 2022-10-28 at 11.10.43 PM.png" alt="home page">
<p> 
The e-commerce project was a good learning experience because I had to learn new skills in order to complete the assignment. 
I chose to use my business as the focus of this project because it is something that I am proud of.     
    <a href="https://main.d67mkad6vjczp.amplifyapp.com/" title="Ecommerce Project" target="_blank">
        Get It There Dispatching LLC</a> was started on June 18, 2022. 
        Prior to Road To Hire, I worked in a call center which was basically AAA for commercial vehicles. 
        I did not enjoy the job because there were many situations where I could not help the driver. 
        When I could not help a driver it meant them sitting either on the side of the road 
        or wherever they were parked until their dispatchers came into work the following morning. 
        I did not enjoy that portion of the job because there were occasions when the driver was not in a safe location. 
        I decided to start <a href="https://main.d67mkad6vjczp.amplifyapp.com/" title="Ecommerce Project" target="_blank">
            Get It There Dispatching LLC</a> because I wanted to provide a variety services for owner operators that would keep them on the 
            road when they wanted to run routes and at home when they wanted a break.
            I wanted a dispatching company that catered to the needs of drivers who are often ignored. 

            <p class="reflect"> 
                To complete this project I had to implement three new skills. 
                Originally, I did not know where to begin. 
                I had various ideas on what product I wanted to sell but none of them felt right. 
                I finally realized that I could use something that I know which is services for commercial vehicles. 
                After settling on the overall theme for the project, I had to come up with twelve products.
                Coming up with twelve products was fairly easy but one if the new skills was using a new method to display the products. 
                For that portion of the project I watched various videos and reached out to my tech mentor. 
                Another new skill I had to learn was making a slideshow on the homepage using a language called JavaScript.
                At the time, we were just learning the language so it was unfamiliar to me, but I watched one YouTube video 
                that allowed me to complete that portion of the project effortlessly. 
                Lastly, the website had to be deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) which is used to host websites.
                I have had previous experience with learning about what AWS was but I did not know how to deploy a website.
                After speaking with my peers, I was able to complete this portion of the project easily. 
                Because of the skills learned from this project, I was able to use AWS to host my portfolio webpage.
