            This webpage will display my reflections throughout the first portion of the apprenticeship. 
            Throughout the first three months of the program I have learned a lot about myself. 
            There have been various challenging assignments that have stumped me.
            Normally, if there is something that I didn't think I couldn't accomplish I wouldn't even try. 
            Lately, I have found myself reading various resources, staying up late, and reaching out for help. 
            People in my cohort have been extremely helpful when I needed support with anything both personal and professional. 
            Being apart of Cohort 11 has taught me that it is okay to reach out for help and it is okay to not know everything. 
            Before getting into the program I did not like reaching out for help because I thought I would be perceived as less than. 
            I am currently learning that it is better to ask for help than to struggle especially when others are offering assistance. 
            I have also learned that I am extremely persistent. 
            I tend to stay up late working on assignments to ensure I only submit quality work. 
            Road To Hire has taught me that if you want something you have to work for it. 
            I cannot wait to see what other lessons I learn in the second half of the program.

        <h3>Photo Backstory Activity </h3>

<p>
I chose this work sample because this was the first public speaking exercise I did after being accepted into the program. 
I was looking through my album trying to figure out what image I could talk about. 
When I came across this picture I knew I could tell a story that would resonate with a lot of my peers because
there are many of us who are either a parent or who are around children often. 
After submitting this image I was unsure what story I wanted to tell, so I listened to my peers' speeches to get inspiration. 
Finally, I decided I wanted my overall message to convey the importance of letting children be children. 
<p>
    This exercise was a good reflection piece for me because I learned the importance of receiving feedback.
    While there was structure in the speech I was told it could have been better which is something that I wanted to implement in my next speech. 
    Another area I needed to work on was vocal variety. 
    When I did my next speech I made sure to include areas in my speech where I varied my tone so I could keep the audience engaged. 
    Although I did not get a perfect score on my next speech, I did show improvement in these two areas. 
    I believe a sign of growth is implementing constructive criticism and feedback.

<h3>E-commerce Project</h3>

<p> 
The e-commerce project was a good learning experience because I had to learn new skills in order to complete the assignment. 
I chose to use my business as the focus of this project because it is something that I am proud of.     
    <a href="https://main.d67mkad6vjczp.amplifyapp.com/" title="Ecommerce Project" target="_blank">
        Get It There Dispatching LLC</a> is my business that was started in Summer of 2022. 
        Prior to Road To Hire, I worked in a call center which was basically AAA for commercial vehicles. 
        I did not enjoy the job because there were many situations where I could not help the driver. 
        When I could not help a driver it meant them sitting either on the side of the road 
        or wherever they were parked until their dispatchers came into work the following morning. 
        I did not enjoy that portion of the job because there were occasions when the driver was not in a safe location. 
        I decided to start <a href="https://main.d67mkad6vjczp.amplifyapp.com/" title="Ecommerce Project" target="_blank">
            Get It There Dispatching LLC</a> because I wanted to provide a variety services for owner operators that would keep them on the 
            road when they wanted to run routes and at home when they wanted a break.
            I wanted a dispatching company that catered to the needs of drivers who are often ignored.
