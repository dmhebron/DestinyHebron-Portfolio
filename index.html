        <p>
            This webpage will display my reflections throughout the first portion of the apprenticeship. 
            Throughout the first three months of the program I have learned a lot about myself. 
            There have been various challenging assignments that have stumped me.
            Normally, if there is something that I didn't think I couldn't accomplish I wouldn't even try. 
            Lately, I have found myself reading various resources, staying up late, and reaching out for help. 
            People in my cohort have been extremely helpful when I needed support with anything both personal and professional. 
            Being apart of Cohort 11 has taught me that it is okay to reach out for help and it is okay to not know everything. 
            Before getting into the program I did not like reaching out for help because I thought I would be perceived as less than. 
            I am currently learning that it is better to ask for help than to struggle especially when others are offering assistance. 
            I have also learned that I am extremely persistent. 
            I tend to stay up late working on assignments to ensure I only submit quality work. 
            Road To Hire has taught me that if you want something you have to work for it. 
            I cannot wait to see what other lessons I learn in the second half of the program.
